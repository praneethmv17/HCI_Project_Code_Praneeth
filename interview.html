                <li class="answerMarker">I liked the fact that this world was teeming under New York City and nobody was aware of it. That you could be going along preoccupied with your own problems and then whoosh! You take a wrong turn in your laundry room and suddenly a giant cockroach is right in your face. No magic, no space or time travel, there’s just a ticket to another world behind your clothes dryer.</li>

                        But Gregor is much braver than I am…if I even see a regular sized rat in New York City I immediately cross the street.</li>

                <li class="answerMarker">I wish I could say that after I researched the creepy animals I was no longer at all afraid of them…but that would be a big fib! Cockroaches aren’t really scary, just a little germy, so I don’t mind them much. I love bats…except these really loud ones that get in my attic in the summer and hold some kind of party all night long. Spiders still scare me some, although I’m also fascinated by them and I can happily watch them from a distance. But rats…not pet rats but the wild kind…I will always have what I consider to be a healthy fear of rats. You should, too.

        <div class="answer">
            <ul class="answerMarkerUL">
                <li class="answerMarker">I lived in New York City for 16 years, from 1987 to 2003. But when I was growing up we moved all the time because my dad was in the Air Force. We were mostly on the eastern half of the U.S. and in Europe but, like Gregor, I definitely know what it feels like to be a stranger somewhere.</li>

        <div class="question">
            <ul class="questionMarkerUL">
                <li class="questionMarker">If you had to go to the Underland, what items would you take along with you? And who would you take with you? </li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="answer">
            <ul class="answerMarkerUL">
                <li class="answerMarker">I’d take all the flashlights and batteries I could find. I’d also take a couple of bottles of water and chocolate, because I don’t like traveling without either of these things. I would wear very comfortable clothes and sneakers…in case I had to run.
                        <br /><p>My husband, Cap, would be great to have in the Underland, since he is very good in an emergency, but I’d want him to be with our kids up in the Overland so I’d know they were in safe hands.</p>
                        (Note: Cap says he would not take me to the Underland because I am not good in an emergency and I would constantly make him stop and ask for directions. Both of these things are true.)</p>
                        So I think I would take my good friend Christopher Santos with me, because he is very diplomatic and travels a lot and he seems at ease in foreign places. Also, he would never make loud, mean remarks about the creatures which could get a person in all kinds of trouble.</p>
                        In the Underland, I would make it my first order of business to hook up with a couple of bats because, let’s face it, without a bat you’re probably going to end up as someone’s lunch.</li>

                <li class="answerMarker">I would invite Ripred to dinner because I think he would tell the most interesting stories. We would have to serve shrimp in cream sauce because this is his favorite dish of all. Just to irritate him, I would tell him he has to use a napkin—or he won’t get dessert. He would use the napkin, because dessert would be a fabulous chocolate cake and he loves food, but I bet he would glare at me the whole time. 
                    <br /><p>I would ask all kinds of questions about being a rat, and living alone in the Dead Land, and about his family. Ripred sometimes sneaks up to the Overland, so I would ask him his opinion of New York City, too.</p>
                    After dinner, we’d play Scrabble.</p></li>

                <li class="questionMarker">All fun aside for a moment, Gregor is also about war and battling forces and survival. Can you tell us a little bit about this?"</li>

        <div class="answer">
            <ul class="answerMarkerUL">
                <li class="answerMarker">Gregor falls into a fantastical world, but he’s really acting out the main role in a war story. Almost as soon as he arrives in the Underland, he’s recognized as the “warrior” of the prophecies and he’s called upon to undertake what are essentially a series of military missions. For instance, in Book I he goes into enemy territory to rescue a prisoner of war who also happens to be his dad. It’s never described as such, but that’s what’s really happening.

                    <br /><p>As the series continues, Gregor is faced with increasingly difficult quests and choices as the Underland breaks into a massive global war. His struggle to survive-both physically and spiritually-forms the arc of The Underland Chronicles.</p></li>
